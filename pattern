*Eyes:*
// Note: the eyes are a little complicated, so apologies there. I tried to explain what I did the best I could.
using white yarn, ch 8
R1: hdc 3 times in the 2nd ch from hook, sc in next ch, sl st in next 3 chs, sc in next ch, hdc 3 times in last ch, and continue around to the other side of the chain (do not turn). You're circling around the chain.
R2: hdc in 1st st, sc in next st, sl st in next 2 stitches, sc, hdc, then sl st in next st.
R3: ch1, DO NOT TURN, sc, sc inc in next 2 st, sl st in next 5 st, sc, sc inc in next 2 st, sl stitch.
Finish off,  leaving tail long enough to sew the eyes onto the face.

*Assembly:*
Using a yarn needle, sew eyes onto face (see picture), then sew nose and mouth using white yarn.
